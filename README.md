# Multiple counter React App
_______________________________
## 3 counters 
- Each card has an input field and a button
- If the input field is empty, the button is not active
- If not empty â€” active
- You can enter a number in the field

## Logic
>Initially, in all the upper cards, the fields are empty, the buttons are inactive
>In the bottom card "Result: 0"
>
>When you enter a number in the field in the card, the button becomes active
>By clicking on the button, the number entered in the field is added to the counter in the bottom card
>In this case, the value in the field is reset
>The value of the field should be checked for the number type. If the entered value is not a number, do not send it.
